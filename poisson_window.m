function w = poisson_window(n,alpha)

% HANNPOISSWIN Symmetric Hanning-Poisson window
%    HANNPOISSWIN(N,ALPHA) returns a symmetric N point Hanning-
%    Poisson window with parameter ALPHA.
%
%    The window is similar to the Poisson window, and as ALPHA
%    increases, the zeros of the sidelobe structure disappear,
%    and the lobes merge into the assymptote.  The window has
%    no sidelobes for alpha >= 2, and as such, is useful in hill
%    climbing optimization methods.
